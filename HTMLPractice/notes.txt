Explanation of Each Part
<!DOCTYPE html>

Declares the document type as HTML5.
Ensures the browser renders the page in standard mode.
<html lang="en">

The root element of an HTML document.
The lang="en" attribute specifies the language of the document (English in this case).
<head>

Contains metadata (information about the document).

Key Elements in <head>:

<meta charset="UTF-8">: Ensures proper text encoding for various characters.
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">: Makes the webpage responsive on all devices.
<title>Document</title>: Sets the title of the webpage (visible in the browser tab).
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">: Links an external CSS file for styling.
<script src="script.js" defer></script>: Links an external JavaScript file with defer, ensuring it loads after the HTML is parsed.
<body>

Contains the content of the webpage (text, images, links, etc.).
In this example, it contains an <h1> heading with "Hello, World!".
Uses of HTML Boilerplate
Ensures Proper Page Structure

Provides a well-formed document structure that browsers can interpret correctly.
Faster Development

Acts as a template, so developers donâ€™t need to rewrite common elements for every new project.
Improves SEO and Accessibility

The <title> and <meta> tags help with search engine rankings and user experience.
Enhances Cross-Browser Compatibility

The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration ensures the page is rendered consistently across different browsers.
Supports Mobile Responsiveness

The <meta name="viewport"> tag makes the page adapt to different screen sizes.
