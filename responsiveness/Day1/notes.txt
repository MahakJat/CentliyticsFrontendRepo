work with % to make the websites responsive avoid giving heights and width fixed values

em font size is related to parent fontsize if no font on parent then default is 16px 
in em for margin and padding it looks for current div font sizee

rem look for the font size of root that is html


em and rem use karne se hum media query me sirf ek jagah change 
karge toh sare pages ke font size change ho jata hai rather then har ek element me alag change

use of vh vw for title is really good because it change on changing the viewport (use vh more not vw because the font may become too small on making view port small)
